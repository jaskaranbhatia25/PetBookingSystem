# PetBookingSystem
This is a project based on (OOPS) java which builds an application regarding everything required for the proper nourishing of a pet.

The owners of YYC Pet Resort, a rapidly growing boarding facility for cats and dogs, need to
design an application to organize their client and facility information.
According to the company owners:
"The pet is at the core of our business. We take special care to learn everything we can about
our boarders.
"Of course, clients are important, too. We try to retain a relationship with them regardless of
their situation. Even when a pet has passed away, we keep their name, phone number, and
address on file. We want to be sure that if they adopt a new pet they will think of us for their
boarding needs.
"We're very careful to keep a care profile for each pet, which includes feeding instructions, a
medication list, and medication instructions. We make a print-out of the care instructions for all
pets in our care, which are posted so that staff don't have to search for this information. We can
also pull up the complete care profile on the computer."
Lalitha Chitnis, manager of the northwest Calgary store, described some of the functionality she
needs to perform her duties.
"Whenever a new employee joins, I enter their name and then I have to assign them an ID
number. I also assigned them a manager by inputting their supervisor’s ID, and then I add the
new employee’s ID to the manager’s list of supervised employees. Each manager can supervise a
maximum of 10 employees.
Thomas Walls, head of advertising, specified additional requirements:
"The rewards profile is really important to the business. We keep the rewards number and
points total. It's an important part of the client profile, but of course not every client is part of
the rewards program, though we really encourage them to enroll. When they're not enrolled, I
just see their reward number as 'Not enrolled'. They get 10 points just for enrolling.
"They get points for every time they board with us, and in the end that can translate to things
like a complimentary grooming. Once a month, we pick a rewards profile at random and give a
free day of boarding to the winner, regardless of their rewards points. This makes it worthwhile
for all clients to enroll in the program, even if they don't board often enough to earn many
points. When I'm looking at a client's information, I can immediately see their rewards profile
and tell them how close they are to earning a reward."
